Insertion sort, selection sort , bubble sort have the time complexity of pf o(n ^2)

Merge sort have the time complexity of 0(n log n), it's better than insertion, selection , bubble but it will require more space to perform sorting,so it's have have space complexity when compared to others

Quick sort have the time complexity of o(n log n) it's better than quick sort because it's doesn't get more space. It have less space complexity when compared to merge sort. If the array is sorted it will have the time complexity of o(n^2) when the aray is sorted or partially sorted then we can go with merge sort instead of quick sort

Graph has edge and vertex

Edge is a link

Vertex is a node

Graph has two ways 

Adjacency matrix
Adjacency list

Complexity

   To store the vertex at the pointer

       Adjacency matrix takes o(v power 2)
       Adjacency list takes o( v + e)
    Efficient is adjacent list

 Adding a vertex                     
       Adjacency matrix takes 0(v power 2)
      Adjacency list takes o(1)
     
    Efficient is adjacent list

Adding an edge 
       Adjacency matrix takes o(1)
       Adjacency matrix takes o(1)

Removing an edge
       Adjacency matrix takes 0(1)
       Adjacency list takes 0(e)
     Efficient is adjacent matrix

Removing an vertex
    Adjacency matrix takes 0(v power 2 )
    Adjacency list takes o(v + e)

Conclusion adjacent list is more effecient when compared to adjacency matrix
